- Write script to streamline
- Determine which objects in catalog are imaged in LDP
    1. Only include objects that have zLDP
    2. Compile a list of RA and DEC of every object
    3. Pass this into wcstran to convert to image pixel value
    4. Remove objects that are outside of the acceptable range
        - UVIS: 0 < x < 4136, 0 < y < 4394
        - ACS : 0 < x < 4222, 0 < y < 4244
        - Need 100 pixels in the image
    5. This can then be compared to files located in galaxy_evolution/old/galaxy_evolution/cutCatalog/pixelCoords
- Make cutouts
- Rewrite classification script
    - Should be written in a way that makes combining the results much easier
